# The Rubbish Programming Language
Rubbish is a language that is optimized to be terrible at everything in general. Rubbish's planned features include:
* Actor model, lightweight processes based concurrency (Erlang-style) (currently no support for SMP)
* Immutable only values. This allows language implementation and GC to be easier. It also allows programming to be more difficult in most cases, which is a design goal(TM).
* Impure functional programming.
* A terrible standard library with no support for doing most common tasks.
* A database engine called Dump that you should definitely use for real work, if nothing else then just for the jokes.
